## Source Code Changes

### You are a team member/collaborator of this project 

1. Create a branch from `main` with a descriptive, kebab-cased name
   to hold all your changes.

2. Modify the code and push your changes to your branch. Make sure that
   the triggered CI checks all pass.

3. Once the changes are ready to be reviewed, create a GitHub pull
   request.  With the pull request, provide a description of the
   changes and links to any relevant issues (in this repository or
   others). 

4. Ensure that the triggered CI checks all pass.  These are triggered
   automatically with the results shown directly in the pull request.

5. Once the checks pass, assign the pull request to the repository
   coordinator (who may then assign it to someone else).

6. Interact with the reviewer to address any comments.

When the reviewer is happy with the pull request, he/she will "squash
& merge" the pull request and delete the corresponding branch.
